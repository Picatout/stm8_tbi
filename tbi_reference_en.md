### Data types 

The only data type supported is 24 bits signed integers in range **-8388608...8388607**.

For [PRINT](#print) and [INPUT](#input) commands and only for these 2 commands quoted string are supported. 

Also **\c**,  i.e. a backslash followed by an ASCII character is also supported by **PRINT** and as parameter for some commands. 

It is also possible to print a character from its ASCII code usint [CHAR](#char) function. This function can also be used in expressions. When an expression using [CHAR](#char) function is given as a parameter to command [PRINT](#print) the [CHAR](#char) function must not be the first factor of the expression.
```
 >? char(33),2*char(33)
!	66 

>? char(33)*2
!
run time error, syntax error
    0 ? CHAR ( 33 ) * 

>
```

### Variables 

In Tiny BASIC there was only 26 variables given the names of alphabet letters {**A..Z**}. This hold in this BASIC but more variables can be created using keyword [DIM](#dim). The maximum length of the dynamic variables is 15 characters. 

### Array 
There is a predefine single dimension array named **'@'**. A minimum 10 elements are reserved for this array but its actual size depend on program size and the number of dynamic variables and constants defined in the program.
The leftover free space is given to **@** array. 

The first indice of the array is **1** and the last is known by invoking [UBOUND](#ubound) function. 

### Labels 
**Labels** are name used as first element of a BASIC line to identify a [GOSUB](#gosub) or [GOTO](#goto) target. 

Labels name have the same format as dynamic variables and constants names. 

1. Maximum 15 characters 
1. Begin with a letter 
1. Can include digits,'**.**','**_**' and '**?**' characters

<a id="expressions"></a>
### Arithmetic expressions
There is 5 arithmetic operators, plus parenthesis. Order of priority is:

1. '**(**'expression'**)**'
1. '**-|+**' unary minus or plus.  
1. '__*__' multiplication, '__/__' division and '__%__' modulo 
1. '__+__' addition and '__-__' substraction

Quotient is rounded toward zero. 

### Relational operators 
Expressions can be compared for size with the following operators. Relations return -1 for true and 0 for false.

1. **'&gt;'**   True if left is greater than right expression.
1. **'&lt;'** True if left is smaller than right expression.
1. **'&gt;='** True if left is greater or equal to right expression. 
1. **'&lt;='** True if left is smaller or equal to right expression. 
1. **'='** True if both expressions have the same value. 
1. **'&lt;&gt;'** or **'&gt;&lt;'** True if expressions have a different value.

### Boolean operators 
The **NOT**,**AND**,**OR** and **XOR** are binary operators like their machine level equivalent. But as relations return only **0|-1** they are effective as boolean expression operators used as condition in [IF](#if) and [UNTIL](#until) statement.

<a id="syntax"></a>
### Syntax 
The code use for writing program is [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Standard_Code_for_Information_Interchange).

Each program line start with a line number in range {1..32767} followed optionally by a label then a list of commands separated by **':'** character. If no line number is given the line is compiled and interpreted immedialety.
```
>let t=ticks:for i=1 to 10000: let a=10:next i : ? ticks-t
400  
```
A command is followed by its parameters list. The comma separate the parameters. Function parameters must be between parentheses but functions without parameters don't require parenthesis. 

As names can comprise digits it is important to put a space after a command or function name if it is followed by un number. 
```
?3*5  ' don't need space after '?'.
 15 

> for i=1to 100 :? i;: next i  ' need a space between 'to' and '100' 
```

Names can be entered in lower case and are converted to upper case. The language is not case sensitive.

The command [PRINT](#print) can be replacec by [?](#print).

The keyword [REM](#rem) can be replaced by a tick **'**. 

End of line mark the end of command. There is no command continuation on next line.

### Numeric bases
Integers can be typed in 3 numeric bases. 

1. Decimal: ['-'|'+']*digit+
    * -1343 
    * +4677 
    * 987
1. Hexadecimal: ['-'|'+']*hex_digit+
    * -$ffe
    * +$134a
    * $A5a5
1. binary: ['-'|'+']*['0'|'1']+
    * -%101
    * +%1011
    * %11111101 

Integers are printable only in decimal or hexadecimal.

## Command line

At startup a beep is sounded and system information is displayed on terminal. followed by
**&gt;** which is the prompt.

```
From there the user can enter direct commands or edit program lines. A line is limited to 79 characters and edition is terminated by **ENTER** key. When **ENTER** is pressed the input text is compiled to a tokens list. If there no line number this tokens list is executed immediately.

Otherwise the line is inserted in program space in RAM area. 

* Line numbers are limited to range {1...32767}.

* if an existing line with the same number as the last edited one exist the new one 
replace it. 

* If the new line as no text an a line with that number exist then it is erased.  

* Lines are inserted sorted in increasing line number. 

Some commands can only be used in direct mode others only inside programs. An error is displayed if a command is used in bad context. 

The program in RAM is lost each time then MCU is resetted but it can be save in FLASH memory using [SAVE](#save) commmand.

On Linux systems it is possible to write programs in a text editor on the PC the send it to the board using [send.sh](send.sh) script.

### Editing hot keys

The following hot keys can be used while entering a text line in terminal.

key|function 
-|-
BS|Delete character left of cursor 
ln CTRL+E|**ln** being a line number this display that line for editing. 
CTLR+R|Redisplay last line entered.
CTRL+D|Delete currently edted line. 
HOME| Move cursor to beginning of line.
END| Move cursor to end of line.
left arrow| Move cursor left one character. 
right arrow| Move cursor right one character.
CTRL+O|Toggle between insert and overwirte mode. Cursor change shape.
