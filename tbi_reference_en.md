### Data types 

The only data type supported is 24 bits signed integers in range **-8388608...8388607**.

For [PRINT](#print) and [INPUT](#input) commands and only for these 2 commands quoted string are supported. 

Also **\c**,  i.e. a backslash followed by an ASCII character is also supported by **PRINT** and as parameter for some commands. 

It is also possible to print a character from its ASCII code usint [CHAR](#char) function. This function can also be used in expressions. When an expression using [CHAR](#char) function is given as a parameter to command [PRINT](#print) the [CHAR](#char) function must not be the first factor of the expression.
```
 >? char(33),2*char(33)
!	66 

>? char(33)*2
!
run time error, syntax error
    0 ? CHAR ( 33 ) * 

>
```

<a id="variables"></a>
### Variables 

In Tiny BASIC there was only 26 variables given the names of alphabet letters {**A..Z**}. This hold in this BASIC but more variables can be created using keyword [DIM](#dim). The maximum length of the dynamic variables is 15 characters. 

### Array 
There is a predefine single dimension array named **'@'**. A minimum 10 elements are reserved for this array but its actual size depend on program size and the number of dynamic variables and constants defined in the program.
The leftover free space is given to **@** array. 

The first indice of the array is **1** and the last is known by invoking [UBOUND](#ubound) function. 

### Labels 
**Labels** are name used as first element of a BASIC line to identify a [GOSUB](#gosub) or [GOTO](#goto) target. 

Labels name have the same format as dynamic variables and constants names. 

1. Maximum 15 characters 
1. Begin with a letter 
1. Can include digits,'**.**','**_**' and '**?**' characters
<hr>

[main index](#main-index)
<a id="expressions"></a>
### Arithmetic expressions
There is 5 arithmetic operators, plus parenthesis. Order of priority is:

1. '**(**'expression'**)**'
1. '**-|+**' unary minus or plus.  
1. '__*__' multiplication, '__/__' division and '__%__' modulo 
1. '__+__' addition and '__-__' substraction

Quotient is rounded toward zero. 

### Relational operators 
Expressions can be compared for size with the following operators. Relations return -1 for true and 0 for false.

1. **'&gt;'**   True if left is greater than right expression.
1. **'&lt;'** True if left is smaller than right expression.
1. **'&gt;='** True if left is greater or equal to right expression. 
1. **'&lt;='** True if left is smaller or equal to right expression. 
1. **'='** True if both expressions have the same value. 
1. **'&lt;&gt;'** or **'&gt;&lt;'** True if expressions have a different value.

### Boolean operators 
The **NOT**,**AND**,**OR** and **XOR** are binary operators like their machine level equivalent. But as relations return only **0|-1** they are effective as boolean expression operators used as condition in [IF](#if) and [UNTIL](#until) statement. 
<hr>

[main index](#main-index)
<a id="syntax"></a>
### Syntax 
The code use for writing program is [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Standard_Code_for_Information_Interchange).

Each program line start with a line number in range {1..32767} followed optionally by a label then a list of commands separated by **':'** character. If no line number is given the line is compiled and interpreted immedialety.
```
>let t=ticks:for i=1 to 10000: let a=10:next i : ? ticks-t
400  
```
A command is followed by its parameters list. The comma separate the parameters. Function parameters must be between parentheses but functions without parameters don't require parenthesis. 

As names can comprise digits it is important to put a space after a command or function name if it is followed by un number. 
```
?3*5  ' don't need space after '?'.
 15 

> for i=1to 100 :? i;: next i  ' need a space between 'to' and '100' 
```

Names can be entered in lower case and are converted to upper case. The language is not case sensitive.

The command [PRINT](#print) can be replacec by [?](#print).

The keyword [REM](#rem) can be replaced by a tick **'**. 

End of line mark the end of command. There is no command continuation on next line.
<hr>

<a id="bases"></a>
### Numeric bases
Integers can be typed in 3 numeric bases. 

1. Decimal: ['-'|'+']*digit+
    * -1343 
    * +4677 
    * 987
1. Hexadecimal: ['-'|'+']*hex_digit+
    * -$ffe
    * +$134a
    * $A5a5
1. binary: ['-'|'+']*['0'|'1']+
    * -%101
    * +%1011
    * %11111101 

Integers are printable only in decimal or hexadecimal.

## Command line

At startup a beep is sounded and system information is displayed on terminal. followed by
**&gt;** which is the prompt.
```

```
From there the user can enter direct commands or edit program lines. A line is limited to 79 characters and edition is terminated by **ENTER** key. When **ENTER** is pressed the input text is compiled to a tokens list. If there no line number this tokens list is executed immediately.

Otherwise the line is inserted in program space in RAM area. 

* Line numbers are limited to range {1...32767}.

* if an existing line with the same number as the last edited one exist the new one 
replace it. 

* If the new line as no text an a line with that number exist then it is erased.  

* Lines are inserted sorted in increasing line number. 

Some commands can only be used in direct mode others only inside programs. An error is displayed if a command is used in bad context. 

The program in RAM is lost each time then MCU is resetted but it can be save in FLASH memory using [SAVE](#save) commmand.

On Linux systems it is possible to write programs in a text editor on the PC the send it to the board using [send.sh](send.sh) script.

### Editing hot keys

The following hot keys can be used while entering a text line in terminal.

key|function 
-|-
BS|Delete character left of cursor 
ln CTRL+E|**ln** being a line number this display that line for editing. 
CTLR+R|Redisplay last line entered.
CTRL+D|Delete currently edted line. 
HOME| Move cursor to beginning of line.
END| Move cursor to end of line.
left arrow| Move cursor left one character.

### USR(*addr*,*expr*) {C,P}
This function is used to call a machine code routine. The machine code routine return a value on data stack.

*  *addr*  is address of machine code routine
* *expr* is a value used as input parameter to subroutine.
* An integer is pushed to data stack by the machine code routine.

In the following example the machine code stored in DATA line is written to FLASH 
memory then it is called to compute the square of a small integer.

If there is space available in RAM a [BUFFER](#buffer) for machine code can be created in RAM and data [poked](#poke) to that buffer instead of [writting](#write) it to FLASH. That would reduce FLASH wear out.

### WAIT *expr1*,*expr2*[,*expr3] {C,P}
This command wait for a change of state in a register or memory.
* *expr1*  address of register or memory
* *expr2*  AND mask to apply to value at address.
* *expr3*  XOR mask to apply after the AND mask. If the parameter is missing value **0** is used. 

This command can be used to wait for an input pin to switch from low to high and verse-versa. Or for some register state change. The following example poke a value to UART1_DR register and wait for the transmission to complete by polling bit 6 of UART1_SR register as this bit goes to **1** when transmission is completed.
```
>poke $5231,65:wait $5230,bit(6)

### WRITE *expr1*,*expr2*[,*expr*]* 
This command is used to write data to persistant memory, i.e. EEPROM and FLASH. 
* *expr1* is the starting address.
* *data1*,_[,data2]*_ is a list of data elements to be written in consecutives adressess.
these data elements can be of 3 types.
   * integer expression resulting in value {0..255}. If value is &gt;255 only the least significant byte is used. 
   * Quoted string, written as zero terminated string.
   * escaped character, i.e. **\c** where **c** is any ASCII character.

### Files system 

The are edited in RAM to minimize wear out of FLASH. Once a program is debugged it should be saved in FLASH memory.  The file system is a very simple one. As the MCU block erase is organized in block 128 bytes the file system is orgnaize around this size. So a program file always take a multiple of 128 bytes in FLASH memory. The memory used for this file system is the one left after Tiny BASIC. When no files are saved the size can be known by the following command:
```
Tiny BASIC for STM8
Copyright, Jacques Deschenes 2019,2022
version 2.5R1

>? $1000-uflash
-44032 

>? $10000-uflash
17408 
``` 
As program files saved in this file system are executed in situ, the file system doesn't use extended memory, i.e. memory address over 65535. 

Executing BASIC program in extended memory would require a modification to interpreter that would increase its size and slow it down. As it is not all STM8 MCU that have extended memory the choice was made to limit the system to {0...65535} memory range. But extended memory can be used for program data storage. It can  be written with command [WRITE](#write) and read with function [PEEK](#peek).

### Firmware installation

The first step is to select options in [config.inc](config.inc) file. 

* **DEBUG**  should be set to **0** for stable build where debugging is not required.
* **SEPARATE**  should be set to **0** in most case. It is use only when debugging because sdasstm8 assembler message report is quite anoying. It doesn't report in which file there is an error when they are all assembled together.
* **NUCLEO_8S208RB** put this to **1** if this is the target board otherwise set it to **0**.
The **NUCLEO_8S207K8** is automatically selected when this one is deselected.

In the root directory there is bash script [build.sh](build.sh) to launch the build process.
This script take only 2 parameters:
* first parameter **s207** or *s208*  to select the target board.
* second and optional is **flash** if you want to flash the board after successfull build. If the build fail there will be no flash operation. 
```

### Using NUCLEO-8S20x board
STM8 TinyBASIC is developped and built on Ubuntu system but the binary can be flashed on the board on Windows system as well. When the board is connected to PC USB port a new drive appears in file system. Dropping the file [build/TinyBasic.bin](build/TinyBasic.bin) on this drive will flash the firmware on the board. 

The STLINK programmer on the board also emulate a serial port. The only requirement to communicate with TinyBASIC system is to have a terminal emulator configured to connect on that serial port at 115200 BAUD, 8 bit, 1 STOP, no parity. On Windows system [TeraTerm](https://osdn.net/projects/ttssh2/releases/) or [Putty](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) can be used. On Ubuntu there is many options. I use [GTKterm](https://github.com/Jeija/gtkterm)

### Sending a BASIC program to NUCLEO-8S20x board
Although STM8 TinyBASIC as a line editor in the 80'S 8 bits BASIC computer style. Writting your program on the PC using a full featured editor is nice and can be done. 

I have written a small command line tool that can be used to send a BASIC program written on the PC to the board. This tool is only compiled for linux system though. There also bash script in root directory [send.sh](send.sh). This script expect the BASIC program to be in **BASIC** directory.
```
picatout:~/github/stm8_tbi$ ./send.sh blink.bas
port=/dev/ttyACM0, baud=115200,delay=100 
Sending file BASIC/blink.bas

NEW 
1  BLINK
5 ' Blink LED2 on card 
10 DO BTOGL PORTC,BIT(5) PAUSE 500 UNTIL KEY? 
20 LET A=KEY 
30 BRES PORTC,BIT(5) 
40 END 
  
8 lines sent

picatout:~/github/stm8_tbi$ 

```
When the board receive the program the program lines scroll on terminal screen.
