## Introduction 

STM8 TinyBASIC is a simple programming language but that enable all MCU peripherals configuration and usage. Although there is no support for interrupts.
TinyBASIC system istself use the following interrupts

* **TIMER4 Update** that increment an internal milliseconds counter.
* **UART(1 or 3) RX full**, to queue characters received from terminal.
* **I2C** to support TinyBASIC **I2C.xxxx** commands. 
* **AWU** to support TinyBASIC **AWU** command.
* **EXTI4** only on NUCLEO-8S208RB board. That interrupt is triggered by pushing **USER** button.

STM8 TinyBASIC is a simple language for simple microcontrollers projets. 

The system is design to work with host PC of any operating system as it required only a terminal emulator software on the host. The terminal emulator must be **VT100** compatible as TinyBASIC send some ANSI sequences to the host terminal. 

STM8 TinyBASIC project is itself developped on an Ubuntu system and the repository can be found at [https://github.com/Picatout/stm8_tbi](https://github.com/Picatout/stm8_tbi).
